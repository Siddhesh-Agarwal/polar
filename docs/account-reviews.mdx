# Account Reviews

To ensure faster review processing, please make sure the following requirements are met:

## Requirements for Faster Review

### Social Media Validation
- **At least one social media account is required** (client-side validation)
- Social media accounts should be **personal accounts**, not company accounts
- This helps us verify the authenticity of the account holder

### Website Verification
- Ensure your website is working and accessible
- We perform a HEAD request to verify the website returns a 200 status code
- A functional website demonstrates legitimacy and active business operations

### KYC Completion
- Complete your Know Your Customer (KYC) process in the Polar dashboard
- All KYC requirements must be fulfilled before account approval
- This is a mandatory step for account verification

## Review Process

Meeting these requirements will significantly speed up your account review process. Incomplete submissions may result in delays or additional verification steps.
